Features summary:
- adding/removing/editing of screening questions
- defining the question (textarea)
- defining/deleting answer options
- saving (locally) a current state of the question
- some checkboxes which were mentioned in the video clip
- dragging/dropping of questions (mentioned in the clip)

THINGS NEED TO BE DONE
edit form - when working with MVC I can editing is not a problem but doing everything on the front end was a little unfamiliar as far as grabbing the right object. I know I can edit the question title doing input[type='text']  = question.

drag/drop - functional but the question number is not updating.

delete option - currently deletes all options, needed a little more time of figure out just one option.  What I would have done. Give each option and unique id and then use jquery to target that element and remove.
